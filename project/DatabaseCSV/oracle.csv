The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines. An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. Summoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.) A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field. Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them. You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter. While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).

The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings). Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected. Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost. Restore Class: A paladin, or other class, who has lost her class features due to violating the alignment restrictions of her class may have her class features restored by this spell. Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for her god's intercession. Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally. Though the spell DESCRIPTION refers to evil acts, atonement can be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.",PFRPG Core,1,1,0,0,0,3,3,3,4,,3,3,,3,3,3,3,3,3,,,3,"Magic (3), Entropy (3)",Cancels one magical spell or effect.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Dispel Magic,159,,Arcane (7),,"When used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one.

You choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: This functions as a targeted dispel magic, but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Additionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC. Area Dispel: When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by dispel magic. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel. For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area. If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.

The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast. Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble. Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Chapter 13 for more details). Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud. Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned.

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction. Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate. The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. A gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not. Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you-anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel. You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed. Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures. If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time. If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in ""livestock"" rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least.

A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set all of the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded. When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. Mislead, polymorph, and nondetection (and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. Read magic allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored). Note: Magic traps such as glyph of warding are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a glyph, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for glyph of warding. Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell. Blast Glyph: A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect. Spell Glyph: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack.

When the description is done, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away he is, as detailed on the following table.

The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on its own devices to locate you. If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject. If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance. This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.

If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway). You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services. The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD. A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment. At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).

Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects such as charm person, command, and dominate person).

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action. A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time.

Symbol of Death,necromancy,,death,"cleric/oracle 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, witch 8, occultist 6",10 minutes,"V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth 5,000 gp each)",1,0 ft.; see text,,one symbol,,see text,0,0,Fortitude negates,yes,"This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a symbol of death kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again. Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally. As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed. In this case, ""reading"" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe. You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify. When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again. You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them. Read magic allows you to identify a symbol with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the symbol's spell level). Of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol. A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it. Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.

Casting this spell requires a contract between you and the target, explaining what spells are to be imbued and the circumstances that cause the contract to expire. The contract may be as simple as allowing the target one casting of each of the imbued spells (as per imbue with spell ability), or may continue for multiple days or even indefinitely, with the target regaining use of the imbued spells when you next prepare your own spells. You may include any proviso you see fit, such as requiring the target to pray to Asmodeus each morning, or restricting the target to only casting the imbued spells on himself. If the target does not agree to all the conditions in the contract, this spell fails when cast. The contract (and this spell) automatically expires if you or the target dies. While the contract remains in effect, you gain a profane bonus to your Armor Class, saving throws, and checks equal to the highestlevel spell you have imbued. Once you cast this spell, you cannot prepare a new 5th-level spell to replace it until the contract expires. If the number of 5th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active lesser spellcasting contract spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled. Unlike imbue with spell ability, how the target uses the spell has no reflection on your alignment or relationship with Asmodeus; the Prince of Darkness accepts that allowing another access to his magic for good may benefit his plans in the long run. Note that unlike imbue with spell ability, you cannot dismiss this spell; you must abide by the contract's termination clause (though the contract may include a proviso for at-will nullification by either or both parties). This spell cannot be combined with imbue with spell ability or similar spells to give a target more spells than the limit. Example: You cast this spell on your 5 HD fighter cohort after negotiating an appropriate contract, imbuing him with the ability to cast cure moderate wounds, magic weapon, and shield of faith once per day for 1 month. If he casts any of these spells, he recovers them when you prepare your spells. Until the contract ends, your 5th-level spell slot used to cast this spell remains expended and cannot be filled with a new spell.

The power and abilities of this vestige correspond directly to the value of the offering, allowing for three distinct effects. Corrupted Coin: Making a sacrifice worth 1,500 gp corrupts the focus into a ""lucky"" or ""unlucky"" coin as per the caster's will for 1 month. Any creature that bears the coin gains a bonus or penalty (decided by the caster at the time of casting) on all Appraise, Bluff, Craft, and Profession checks. This bonus or penalty is equal to 1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). In addition, the coin can produce an effect similar to the spell augury once per day-its ?ip producing a weal (heads), woe (tails), or nothing result (landing on the edge). Potentially unknown to the bearer (if different from the caster), the caster can telepathically hear any question asked of the coin and, as a free action, influence the result as he chooses. Mammon's Mantle: Making a sacrifice worth 3,000 gp transforms the coin into a kind of infernal aegis for any who swallow the coin. Upon ingesting the coin, the target gains a bonus to Charisma equal to +1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The bearer's blood also takes on a hue like liquid gold and runs slowly, granting him immunity to poison, disease, and aging effects, and causing him to automatically stabilize if reduced to fewer than 0 hit points. Additionally, the bearer can eat gold to heal himself, regaining 1 hit point for every 20 gold pieces he consumes (materials other than gold provide no bene?t). The coin's effects last for 1 day per caster level. Gold Guardian: Making a sacrifice worth 6,000 gp allows the focus coin to animate nearby coins. When cast into a pile of 100,000 coins, an animate hoard forms under the control of the caster. The guardian serves for 1 month. After this month, coins begin disappearing from the guardian at a rate of 100 gp per day, reducing the creature's hit points by 1 per day. When the guardian's hit points reach 0, the guardian collapses and the focus coin is destroyed. Coins lost from the guardian can be replaced, restoring any lost hit points. In addition to the effects of any of these offerings, should the focus coin be swallowed, any being sired or conceived by the creature while the magic is in effect is born as a tie?ing (bearing an indirect relation to Mammon himself).",AP 30,1,1,1,0,0,6,6,6,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,6,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Genius Avaricious,654,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,

Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove) one of the following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration. Alignment: Your plane gains the (mildly) chaos-, good-, evil-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits, GameMastery Guide 187). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have. Bountiful: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations. Elemental: Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water-elemental dominant trait (see Elemental and Energy Traits, GameMastery Guide 186). Gravity: By default a demiplane's gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane's gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional (see Gravity, GameMastery Guide 184). Seasonal: The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4 hours, and so on). Shape: By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size, GameMastery Guide 185). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane. Structure: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).

You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The ""walls"" and ""ceiling"" of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane's environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane's light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane. There are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane's light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use move earth to create a hill or wall of stone to create a barricade. When you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as astral projection, etherealness, or plane shift. You are considered ""very familiar"" with your entire demiplane. As a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using limited wish, mage's disjunction, miracle, or wish and making a successful dispel check. If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by the spell again to create a linked area between the two. You can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp.

Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add to your demiplane (or remove from it) one of the following features (or any of the features described in create demiplane) with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration. Energy: Your plane gains the (minor) negative- or positivedominant energy trait (see Elemental and Energy Traits, GameMastery Guide 186). A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits. Magic: Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait (see Magic Traits, GameMastery Guide 187). If you selected dead magic, you are trapped within your plane unless it has a permanent planar portal (such as the portal feature, below). If you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as ""effects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire"" or ""death spells and spells from the Death or Repose domains."" A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells. Morphic: You may use move earth at will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell's normal casting time, and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes). You are even able to affect rock formations with this ability, though the casting time for this is only half normal. Portal: Your demiplane gains a permanent gate to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you. This gate is always open and usable from both sides, but you can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around it). Time: By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait (see Time, GameMastery Guide 185). You can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 22,500 gp.

This has three effects. First, the target is marked with a magical symbol visible only to members of your faith. This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark). Second, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, cure light wounds cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast prayer, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target's friendship with the cleric. Third, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target. This powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges. This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down. This mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use atonement to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; remove curse also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the reprobation.",Ultimate Magic,1,1,0,0,1,,,5,5,,,4,,,,4,5,,,,,5,,Marked target is shunned by your religion.,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Reprobation,1129,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,5,,0,0,0,

Now, although the spell is still in use chiefly among those that patrol the borders of the Worldwound, other champions of good have carried it with them to all corners of the Inner Sea region. When you cast this spell, you reach into the great beyond and beseech a good-aligned outsider for their aid against evil. The outsider infuses a small portion of its own power into you, making you a powerful force for good. You gain a +2 morale bonus on all Perception checks made against evil creatures, a +2 bonus on Initiative checks, and detect evil as a constant spell-like ability. In addition, once during the spell's duration you can call forth a surge of holy power when fighting an evil creature. Doing so is a swift action that shortens the spell's remaining duration so that its remaining hours of duration become rounds of duration. For the rest of this duration, the surge of power grants you the following benefits: • A +2 sacred bonus to AC • A +4 sacred bonus to Strength • Resistance 5 to acid and fire • A +5 sacred bonus on all Intimidate checks made against evil creatures • Fast healing 2 • Any critical threat roll made against an evil creature with a weapon you wield is automatically confirmed. Although this surge of power can be activated against any evil opponent, this ability activates automatically as soon as you attack any evil outsider, regardless of whether you hit or not, and regardless of whether you actually recognize that the target is in fact an evil outsider. In such cases the activation is a free action. Nongood spellcasters can cast this spell, but doing so causes them to be sickened (for spellcasters who are neither good nor evil) or staggered (for spellcasters who are evil) for the spell's duration.",Inner Sea Magic,1,1,1,0,0,,,6,,,,4,,5,,,6,,,,,6,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1257,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,5

Only permanent magic items may be enhanced by this spell-one-use items and charged items cannot be affected by impart mind. Intelligent magic items cannot be affected by impart mind. When you cast impart mind on a magic item, the item gains an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma score of 10 and gains your alignment. You have no special control over the item once it becomes intelligent, although since it has your alignment, personality conflicts with items you wield won't be a problem. Determine the item's ego normally, as per the rules on intelligent items in the Core Rulebook. An item made intelligent via impart mind communicates via speech and has normal senses to a range of 60 feet. It speaks and reads one language known by you-if you know multiple languages, you may choose which language the item knows. When you cast impart mind on an item, roll once on Table 15-24 on page 534 of the Core Rulebook to randomly determine the item's power-add your caster level to this roll. By expending additional diamond dust in excess of the 1,000 gp worth of material components required to cast this spell, you can gain further bonuses on the d% roll made to determine the item's power. Every additional 100 gp in diamond dust you use in excess grants a cumulative +1 bonus to the roll, up to a maximum additional bonus equal to your caster level. If the item gains the ability to cast a spell, determine the spell it can cast randomly from spells you know of the appropriate level. If the item gains ranks in a skill, it gains ranks in a random skill in which you have at least 1 rank. If you roll above 100, then you can choose one item power on Table 15-24 in the Core Rulebook to grant the item, and the item gains a special purpose. Roll once on Tables 15-25 and 15-26 on page 534 of the Core Rulebook to determine what the item's special purpose and dedicated powers are.

For the duration of the spell, the ship can travel beneath the water as easily as it did above. While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see the Skull & Shackles Player's Guide for details). The ship's pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell's effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel's normal movement. Despite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions. The spell protects the ship and all aboard from the dangers of drowning and pressure, but not from damage from outside obstacles or creatures. The bubble cannot be used offensively and prevents an affected ship from rising into a space that won't accommodate it (like a sea cave too small to contain it or under another vessel). Creatures can enter or leave the bubble at will, but those outside the sphere cannot be forced inside against their will, the sphere proving substantial enough that such creatures may choose whether to enter or to slip away along its sides. At the end of the spell's duration the bubble pops, causing a ship still underwater at that time to gain the sinking condition.

As a full-round action, the subject or an adjacent creature can tear the vines off the subject's body, resetting the speed penalty to just 5 feet, though the vines continue to grow each round thereafter for the spell's duration, requiring additional checks, unless it is actually dispelled. The spell's effects can also be prematurely ended by dealing at least 20 points of fire damage to the subject. When the spell's duration ends or the effect is terminated, the vines immediately wilt and the subject's speed returns to normal. Regardless of the subject's base speed, the vines cannot reduce a creature's speed below 5 feet. This spell has additional effects depending on which version you cast, chosen when you cast the spell.

Each ceremony provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for 1 hour per caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity as well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating in an officiated ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.) Only subjects whose alignments are within one step of your deity can be affected by this spell. If you are using the downtime system from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign, you may use additional resources to augment the effect of a particular ceremony. You may spend 10 Goods, Labor, or Influence or 2 Magic to create a larger ceremony and grant an additional boon that lasts for 1 day per caster level (up to a maximum of 5 days). The type of capital spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific ceremony. Augmented boons affect the creatures touched as well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10 creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god. Unless otherwise stated, use-activated abilities are supernatural abilities and abilities that emulate the effects of a spell are spell-like abilities; in either case, abilities granted by a boon are generally usable only once or until the duration of the spell ends, whichever comes first. Spell-like abilities are cast at a creature's highest caster level gained, or, if the creature has no caster level, CL 1st. Constant or passive effects and bonuses granted by this spell can be dispelled as normal, using your caster level to do so. Funeral: A funeral service must involve a corpse and at least one willing companion or next of kin. The subject gains a +2 sacred bonus against death effects.

In addition to these four ceremonies, each cleric gains two more ceremonies according to her domain. The names of domain ceremonies and their relevant boons are listed below. Unless otherwise noted, each of the following ceremonies requires at least two willing subjects. Air: Celebration of Storms. The subject can use feather fall once.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of creatures with the demon subtype, creatures possessed by demons, creatures under the effects of spells or spell-like abilities cast by demons, or creatures otherwise tainted by demons. Creatures tainted by demons include tieflings with demonic heritages, sorcerers with abyssal bloodlines, creatures affected by a succubus's profane gift, creatures with demonic implants (see page 44 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lords of Chaos, Book of the Damned, Vol. 2), or creatures who have the Demonic Obedience feat (Lords of Chaos 8), and those under significant demonic influence as determined by the GM. This spell does not detect creatures of chaotic evil alignment who are not demons or significantly influenced by demons. Additionally, this spell detects whether or not a portal or similar magical passage leads to the Abyss. 2nd Round: Number of evil auras shed by creatures with the demon subtype in the area, as well as the power of the most potent evil aura present.

Alignment subtypes or other general subtypes (like elemental, extraplanar, or native) cannot be selected. Outsiders without an outsider racial subtype (like genies, night hags, yeth hounds, or xills) are not affected by this spell. This spell creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves when targeted by creatures of the chosen subtype. Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the target creature. This functions in the same fashion as protection from evil, but only when the effect stems from outsiders of the chosen subtype, and the target's saving throw is made with a +4 morale bonus (using the same DC as the original effect). Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures of the chosen subtype in the same manner as detailed in protection from evil. This spell's descriptor varies depending on the outsider race selected, gaining the alignment descriptors opposite to the alignment of the outsider race-for example, lawful and good if the race is chaotic and evil, chaotic if the selected race is lawful, or none if the selected race is neutral.",Demon Hunter's Handbook,1,1,0,0,1,,,2,,,,2,,,,2,2,,,,,2,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1692,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,

For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment. You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change. Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration. This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts. If you're at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.",Mythic Adventures,1,1,1,0,0,7,7,7,6,,,,,,7,,7,,,,,7,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1704,10000,,,,,1,,,7,,,,,,,6,,0,0,0,

You can ask one question per 2 caster levels. The haunt's knowledge is limited to what its original creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke. A haunt often remembers the circumstance that led to its existence (though this recollection might be from the original victim's perspective and therefore not objective), what triggers it, and how it can be laid to rest (destroyed).

This spell has two purposes, and you choose which application to use at the time of casting. Combat Corruption: Each time a creature fails a saving throw to prevent its corruption from progressing (as described in that corruption's Progression section), it advances to the next corruption stage-at stage 3, it loses the battle against its corruption. Using this spell can lower the target's corruption stage by 1. This has no effect if the target isn't at progression stage of 1 or higher. Remove Corruption: You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target creature, as well as the most recently acquired manifestation and its corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of alleviate corruption doesn't reduce the target's corruption stage. If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption. Either application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the target's manifestation level + 3 times the target's corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3 removes the character from player control). Tampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it.

This spell can't contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can't send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar contact entity spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don't know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn't call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast. How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn's overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like scrying, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.

Successfully detecting the flesh puppet as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.

It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can't make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration. The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp.

While trapped in the object, the creature can't take any actions and is immune to spells and spell-like abilities. The creature remains permanently trapped in the object as long the object remains in your possession. Only a freedom, miracle, or wish spell can dispel the enchantment, though destroying the object frees the creature. If you relinquish your stewardship of the object (such as giving it away or leaving it in a remote location or extradimensional space), the trapped creature begins to gain control over the object. It immediately gains the ability to communicate telepathically with any creature now in possession of the object. It still can't take any actions besides communicating but can use feats and skills related to speaking (such as Bluff and Diplomacy). After 1 week of the object being out of your presence, the creature can create a number of haunts with a total CR (that is, the CR of the encounter with all of the haunts at once) equaling 1/4 the creature's Hit Dice. These haunts are centered on the object. The creature can also communicate telepathically up to a range of 100 feet at this point. After 1 month of the object being out of your presence, the CR total of the haunts the trapped creature can create increases to 1/2 its Hit Dice. In addition to telepathy, it can also impart mental images of its choosing into the mind of any creature holding or carrying the object. After 1 year of being out of your presence, in addition to the above abilities, the creature can attempt to possess any living creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that touches the object, as per possessionOA. However, the creature can't personally destroy the object, even while possessing another creature. Because the binding magic irrevocably weakens the longer you're away from the item, returning it to your ownership doesn't reverse any of the effects. You must free the creature and impose another sacramental seal if you want to restrict its abilities again. If the object is placed in the stewardship of creatures or a location belonging to your faith, it still counts as being out of your presence but it takes ten times longer for the creature to manifest the above abilities (it would take 10 weeks for it to manifest the ability to create haunts, for example).",Horror Adventures,1,1,0,0,0,,,8,,,,,,,,,8,,,,,8,,Seal a creature away inside the spell’s focus.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,2680,2000,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,

The creature can't understand Infernal but understands any languages you know. The dog is normally neutral evil, but is chaotic evil if you are chaotic or lawful evil if you are lawful. For every 3 caster levels you have, you can transform one dog (to a maximum of five dogs at 15th level). At the end of the spell's duration, the dogs immediately dissolve into a stinking pile of gore and bones. You can command the creature in the same way you would a creature you summoned via a summon monster spell. If you buy dogs to use with this spell, they cost 15 gp for a lap dog, 25 gp for a guard dog, or 150 gp for a riding dog (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 82).

Although a successful save prevents the creature from becoming haunted, the haunt still resides within the object, and targets either the next creature to touch the object or the same creature again if it still holds the object after 24 hours. The haunt remains within the object until a creature fails its save or the spell's duration ends. Once a creature is affected by the haunt, it begins noticing a large, black mastiff with ominous green eyes watching and following it from a distance, always just beyond the range of focus or interaction.

Each time the grim stalker lunges at the affected creature, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round. Alternatively, a haunted creature can attempt to force the grim stalker to manifest using a simple ritual that requires a successful Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), or Spellcraft check; occult reagents costing 450 gp (which are consumed as part of the ritual); and a full-round action.

In the case of conflicting commands issued from different true worshipers of Hastur, the commanders must attempt opposed Charisma checks, with the winner being able to command the targets for that round.

If it fails, it is sickened and staggered as it spends part of its action wallowing in its targeted sin (a wrathful victim might waste time spouting threats and profanity, while a slothful victim might merely be slow and hesitant, and a lustful victim could well spend precious moments ogling or fawning over something of beauty).",Adventurer's Guide,1,1,1,0,1,3,3,3,,,2,2,,,3,3,3,,,,,3,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,4896,,,,,,0,,,,,2,,,,,,,0,0,0,

You also summon the restraints' key to your person; the Disable Device DC to open the locked restraints is equal to 15 + your caster level + the modifier of your primary casting ability score. Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell's casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell's DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target's limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the targets together. As you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them. If you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Large restraints. If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints.

You must create the rift on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface-you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid falling into the hole. If successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects and structures that can be fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it. The walls of the rift are covered with razor-sharp blades, while the floor seethes with boiling pools of acid, strange chewing vermin, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the rift takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the rift (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift's environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the rift can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The rift's walls have a Climb DC of 25. When this spell's duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within.

A sacrifice can be used in a variety of ways. Bargain: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being grants you a bonus on opposed Charisma checks made to compel the creature into service for the next hour. Enticement: Making a sacrifice the round before conjuring increases the DC of the Will save an outsider must attempt to resist being conjured. Payment: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being allows you to pay for one service from the creature in commodities other than gold. Reinforcement: Making a sacrifice the round before creating a magic circle and preparing a summoning diagram amplifies the power of its warding magic, increasing the DC of Charisma checks the creature might attempt to escape. This lasts 1 day. Multiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in conjuring and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect for a particular conjuration. A sacrifice can consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including living creatures, treasures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures are more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices. Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to conjure a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target-few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing. The table below lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts provide and the offering's equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of planar ally. Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, or lives, and some can cause changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of miracle or wish. The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature's choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifice effects table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (such as a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses. You cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values. For example, you could not gain 2 permanent negative levels to gain a +16 bonus, nor gain increased benefit from slaying 20 Hit Dice worth of creatures to pay for a 10-HD creature's service.

The liquid functions in all the same ways as unholy water (see curse water). In addition, any creature that is anointed with or drinks this fluid must attempt a Fortitude save (drinking the waters of Lamashtu is particularly effective-a creature that drinks the liquid takes a -4 penalty on its save to resist its effects). Success causes the creature to become violently ill, vomit up the fluid, and become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Failure indicates the water takes root and wreaks havoc on the victim's mind (dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms its body (dealing 1d6 points of Dexterity damage). The subject's Dexterity and Intelligence cannot drop below 1 as a result of this effect. Casting this spell creates approximately 2 ounces of the waters of Lamashtu-enough for one dose or, if bottled, one use as a thrown weapon. The fluid can be created and stored indefinitely, though it cannot be created inside a creature. Extensive exposure to the waters of Lamashtu (such as drinking nothing else for months at a time) can have other long-term effects on the target, including the development of monstrous deformities or even total transformation into a beast, depending on the GM's discretion (these mutations are rarely, if ever, beneficial to the victim).",Book of the Damned,1,1,1,0,0,,,3,3,,,,2,,3,,3,2,,,,3,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,4988,250,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,3,,0,0,0,

When you cast this spell, choose a domain offered by your deity. You gain that domain's benefits from the list below, along with the listed physical changes; abilities that allow a saving throw use this spell's DC. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round-this provokes attacks of opportunity and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less than 10 minutes of the spell's duration remaining, you cannot change the selected domain in this way.

If you perform an action that blatantly violates your deity's precepts while under this spell's effects, invoke deity immediately ends and you are stunned for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. Invoke deity has the same alignment descriptors ([chaotic], [evil], [good], or [lawful]) as your deity's alignment. If an ability duplicates a spell, it functions as that spell heightened to a level equal to your invoke deity spell. Air: You become wispy and translucent. You gain a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability, or you increase your current fly speed by 30 feet-whichever results in a faster speed. While flying, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC. Animal: Your form becomes bestial with animalistic features. You gain low-light vision, scent, a +6 natural armor bonus, and a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size. If you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you increased one size category. You can use speak with animals at will. Artifice: Parts of your body are replaced by pistons and gears. You can be affected by spells that specifically affect constructs (such as make whole). You are immune to bleed, disease, and poison effects, and you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, mind-affecting effects, and necromancy effects. Chaos: Your flesh churns and swirls chaotically. You are immune to additional damage from critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attack damage), and weapons you wield count as chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Charm: You become overwhelmingly attractive and persuasive. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma. Community: Your voice echoes with the sound of multitudes. Select a number of creatures within 30 feet equal to your level divided by three-you gain the effects of status and telepathic bond with those creatures. Darkness: Your eyes become solid black orbs. You become immune to blindness and can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell. Death: Your flesh becomes pallid. You are healed by both positive and negative energy, are immune to energy drain and death effects, and automatically stabilize when reduced below 0 hit points. Destruction: The air around you crackles. You gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with two-handed melee weapons. Spells you cast that cause hit point damage have their save DCs (if any) increased by 1. You gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks to break objects, and you ignore the first 5 points of hardness any object has when you attack it with a melee weapon. Earth: Your flesh becomes stony. You gain DR 10/bludgeoning and are immune to petrification effects. Evil: Your appearance becomes corrupted and fiendish. You automatically confirm critical hits, and weapons you wield count as evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Fire: Your hair ignites into flames. You are immune to fire. As a standard action once per minute, you can fire a ray of flame, as per scorching ray (limit one ray). Glory: Your countenance becomes stern and implacable, and your wrath devastates the undead. You gain the benefits of heroism and protection from evil, and your first successful attack each round against an undead target deals an additional 1d6 points of positive energy damage. Good: Your appearance becomes pristine and angelic. You are immune to fear and compulsion effects, and weapons you wield count as good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Healing: Your appearance becomes hale and hearty. You gain fast healing 3, and your spells and class features that restore hit points each restore an additional 1d8 hit points. Knowledge: You are surrounded by the sound of numerous turning pages. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. Law: A haze of mathematical symbols hovers around you. You are immune to hostile transmutation effects and all confusion effects, and weapons you wield count as lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Liberation: Your form becomes lithe and flexible. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. Luck: The faint sound of tinkling bells plays around you. You gain a +1 luck bonus to your Armor Class and on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks. As an immediate action, you can force a single creature within 10 feet to reroll a single d20 it just rolled-you must use this ability before the results of the d20 roll are known. Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of invoke deity decreases by 10 minutes, and you can't use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell's duration. Madness: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality. As a standard action, you can inflict madness on a creature within 30 feet; that creature must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. You cannot target a creature more than once a minute with this effect. Magic: You shimmer with magical power. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your caster level against hostile spells. Nobility: Your voice becomes resonant and imperious. As a move action, you can issue one order to a single creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as if you had cast the spell command. Plant: Your appearance becomes plantlike, with leafy hair and green skin. You become immune to paralysis, poison, polymorph effects, sleep effects, and stunning. Protection: An aura of protective energy surrounds you. Select three of the following spells: delay poison, false life, mage armor, protection from chaos, protection from evil, protection from good, protection from law, resist energy, shield, or shield of faith; you gain the protective benefits of those spells. Repose: Your eyes become pure, bleak white. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom. Rune: Your skin is marked with runic tattoos. Your presence does not trigger the effects of glyphs of warding, symbol spells, and similar effects unless you choose to, and you are immune to their harmful effects. You can use read magic at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll's caster level. ScalykindB6: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect. Strength: Your body visibly ripples with muscle. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength. Sun: Your form blazes with solar light. You are immune to blindness, the dazzled condition, and all effects generated by powerful light (such as searing light, sunray, or the blinding light of a shining childB2), and you radiate light as the daylight spell. Creatures that are harmed or hindered by sunlight take a -2 penalty on attack rolls against you, and you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects originating from such creatures. Travel: Faint afterimages trail behind you when you move. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Trickery: Your appearance changes as you desire (as veil, except affecting only yourself). Changing your appearance is a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks. VoidB6: Your clothes and hair seem to float about you, as if you were adrift in a weightless environment. You are immune to cold damage and no longer need to breathe. You can exist comfortably in the depths of outer space. War: You are surrounded by the sounds of battle. You gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls with your deity's favored weapon and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with your deity's favored weapon each time you hit a foe. You can use your deity's favored weapon as a divine focus or holy symbol. Water: You gain gills, webbed fingers, and other ichthyic features. You gain a swim speed of 40 feet, can breathe water, and ignore the usual penalties on weapon attack and damage rolls from fighting underwater. Weather: Your hair and clothing are constantly wind-tossed, and you crackle with electricity. You do not take penalties or damage or suffer from reduced visibility or other effects due to natural weather. You are immune to electricity damage, and your call lightning and call lightning storm spells and effects always function as though called outdoors in stormy weather.",Planar Adventures,1,1,1,0,0,,,6,,4,,4,,,6,6,6,4,,,,6,,Infuse yourself with the powers of your deity’s planar realm.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,5003,1000,,,,,0,,,,4,,6,,,,4,,0,0,0,

This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell's casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact. The casting of judgment undone is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell's 10-minute casting time, an olethrosB6 appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless judgment undone has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment-how successful she may be depends on the GM's discretion. The caster of judgment undone can pause the spell's casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on judgment undone and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails. It is possible to cast judgment undone without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM's discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast judgment undone is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it's not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell's casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell's material component, information about the required focus, or even both.

The control granted by quintessence mastery can take one of two forms, depending on the version of the spell cast. Both versions can be cast only on one of the nine Outer Planes, for it is these planes, not the Transitive or Inner Planes, that are comprised of quintessence. Planewarp: This allows the caster to create various objects or effects. When this spell is cast, you can replicate a number of effects from one or more of the following spells: control water, diminish plants, fog cloud, major creation, move earth, plant growth, secure shelter, soften earth and stone, spike growth, spike stones, stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, wall of stone, or wall of thorns. The total spell levels of effects to be created must not exceed 8. For example, you could use this spell to replicate the effects of fog cloud, secure shelter, and soften earth and stone (since these three spells have levels that add up to 8) or diminish plants and spike stones (since these two spells have levels that add up to 7), but not move earth and plant growth (since these two spells have levels that add up to 9). If a spell appears on different spell lists at different levels, use the lowest level-control water, for example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it's a 6th-level spell for sorcerers and wizards. This list need not be exhaustive; at the GM's discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other sources or similarly themed effects that do not mimic specific spells. This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until its effects are expended. Shape Realm: This functions similarly to create demiplaneUM, except that it alters an equivalent area of the plane the caster is on rather than creating a self-contained realm on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. You cannot grant the affected area an alignment or essence trait opposed by the plane's traits (such as granting the lawful-aligned trait to a portion of Elysium), and the area is not self-contained. At the GM's discretion, additional restrictions beyond those listed in the create demiplane spell may limit this spell's effects, and additional options for customizing the affected area may be available. This version of the spell has a casting time of 4 hours and lasts for 1 day per caster level. This version of quintessence mastery can be made permanent in the same way and for the same cost as create demiplane.

You can take up to one creature per level, but all targets must be touching each other. You must specify a location known to you or one of your travelers as your destination when casting this spell. When traveling the otherworldly paths of the Dead Roads, you move at a speed of 50 miles per hour regardless of the terrain on the Material Plane. Your own movement speed does not change; you simply arrive at distant destinations more quickly because the Dead Roads offer a shorter route. You can exit the Dead Roads at any point before reaching your destination by wandering off the path, in which case you are usually returned to your starting place. If this would place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available.
