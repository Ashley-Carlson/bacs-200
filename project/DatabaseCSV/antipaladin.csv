A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.",PFRPG Core,1,1,0,0,0,3,3,3,4,,3,3,,3,3,3,3,3,3,,,3,"Magic (3), Entropy (3)",Cancels one magical spell or effect.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Dispel Magic,159,,Arcane (7),,"When used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.

As noted in animate dead, you can't control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level.

Successfully detecting the flesh puppet as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check. An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can't make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration. The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won't move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so.

The ephemeral string can pass through physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.

The liquid functions in all the same ways as unholy water (see curse water). In addition, any creature that is anointed with or drinks this fluid must attempt a Fortitude save (drinking the waters of Lamashtu is particularly effective-a creature that drinks the liquid takes a -4 penalty on its save to resist its effects). Success causes the creature to become violently ill, vomit up the fluid, and become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Failure indicates the water takes root and wreaks havoc on the victim's mind (dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms its body (dealing 1d6 points of Dexterity damage). The subject's Dexterity and Intelligence cannot drop below 1 as a result of this effect. Casting this spell creates approximately 2 ounces of the waters of Lamashtu-enough for one dose or, if bottled, one use as a thrown weapon. The fluid can be created and stored indefinitely, though it cannot be created inside a creature. Extensive exposure to the waters of Lamashtu (such as drinking nothing else for months at a time) can have other long-term effects on the target, including the development of monstrous deformities or even total transformation into a beast, depending on the GM's discretion (these mutations are rarely, if ever, beneficial to the victim).",Book of the Damned,1,1,1,0,0,,,3,3,,,,2,,3,,3,2,,,,3,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,4988,250,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,3,,0,0,0,

When you cast this spell, choose a domain offered by your deity. You gain that domain's benefits from the list below, along with the listed physical changes; abilities that allow a saving throw use this spell's DC. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round-this provokes attacks of opportunity and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less than 10 minutes of the spell's duration remaining, you cannot change the selected domain in this way. If you change your domain, all ongoing effects from your previously chosen domain end. You must worship a single divinity in order to cast this spell, even if you do not normally cast divine spells. If you perform an action that blatantly violates your deity's precepts while under this spell's effects, invoke deity immediately ends and you are stunned for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. Invoke deity has the same alignment descriptors ([chaotic], [evil], [good], or [lawful]) as your deity's alignment. If an ability duplicates a spell, it functions as that spell heightened to a level equal to your invoke deity spell. Air: You become wispy and translucent. You gain a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability, or you increase your current fly speed by 30 feet-whichever results in a faster speed. While flying, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC. Animal: Your form becomes bestial with animalistic features. You gain low-light vision, scent, a +6 natural armor bonus, and a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size. If you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you increased one size category. You can use speak with animals at will. Artifice: Parts of your body are replaced by pistons and gears. You can be affected by spells that specifically affect constructs (such as make whole). You are immune to bleed, disease, and poison effects, and you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, mind-affecting effects, and necromancy effects. Chaos: Your flesh churns and swirls chaotically. You are immune to additional damage from critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attack damage), and weapons you wield count as chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Charm: You become overwhelmingly attractive and persuasive. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma. Community: Your voice echoes with the sound of multitudes. Select a number of creatures within 30 feet equal to your level divided by three-you gain the effects of status and telepathic bond with those creatures. Darkness: Your eyes become solid black orbs. You become immune to blindness and can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell. Death: Your flesh becomes pallid. You are healed by both positive and negative energy, are immune to energy drain and death effects, and automatically stabilize when reduced below 0 hit points. Destruction: The air around you crackles. You gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with two-handed melee weapons. Spells you cast that cause hit point damage have their save DCs (if any) increased by 1. You gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks to break objects, and you ignore the first 5 points of hardness any object has when you attack it with a melee weapon. Earth: Your flesh becomes stony. You gain DR 10/bludgeoning and are immune to petrification effects. Evil: Your appearance becomes corrupted and fiendish. You automatically confirm critical hits, and weapons you wield count as evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Fire: Your hair ignites into flames. You are immune to fire. As a standard action once per minute, you can fire a ray of flame, as per scorching ray (limit one ray). Glory: Your countenance becomes stern and implacable, and your wrath devastates the undead. You gain the benefits of heroism and protection from evil, and your first successful attack each round against an undead target deals an additional 1d6 points of positive energy damage. Good: Your appearance becomes pristine and angelic. You are immune to fear and compulsion effects, and weapons you wield count as good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Healing: Your appearance becomes hale and hearty. You gain fast healing 3, and your spells and class features that restore hit points each restore an additional 1d8 hit points. Knowledge: You are surrounded by the sound of numerous turning pages. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. Law: A haze of mathematical symbols hovers around you. You are immune to hostile transmutation effects and all confusion effects, and weapons you wield count as lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Liberation: Your form becomes lithe and flexible. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. Luck: The faint sound of tinkling bells plays around you. You gain a +1 luck bonus to your Armor Class and on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks. As an immediate action, you can force a single creature within 10 feet to reroll a single d20 it just rolled-you must use this ability before the results of the d20 roll are known. Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of invoke deity decreases by 10 minutes, and you can't use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell's duration. Madness: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality. As a standard action, you can inflict madness on a creature within 30 feet; that creature must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. You cannot target a creature more than once a minute with this effect. Magic: You shimmer with magical power. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your caster level against hostile spells. Nobility: Your voice becomes resonant and imperious. As a move action, you can issue one order to a single creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as if you had cast the spell command. Plant: Your appearance becomes plantlike, with leafy hair and green skin. You become immune to paralysis, poison, polymorph effects, sleep effects, and stunning. Protection: An aura of protective energy surrounds you. Select three of the following spells: delay poison, false life, mage armor, protection from chaos, protection from evil, protection from good, protection from law, resist energy, shield, or shield of faith; you gain the protective benefits of those spells. Repose: Your eyes become pure, bleak white. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom. Rune: Your skin is marked with runic tattoos. Your presence does not trigger the effects of glyphs of warding, symbol spells, and similar effects unless you choose to, and you are immune to their harmful effects. You can use read magic at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll's caster level. ScalykindB6: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect. Strength: Your body visibly ripples with muscle. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength. Sun: Your form blazes with solar light. You are immune to blindness, the dazzled condition, and all effects generated by powerful light (such as searing light, sunray, or the blinding light of a shining childB2), and you radiate light as the daylight spell. Creatures that are harmed or hindered by sunlight take a -2 penalty on attack rolls against you, and you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects originating from such creatures. Travel: Faint afterimages trail behind you when you move. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Trickery: Your appearance changes as you desire (as veil, except affecting only yourself). Changing your appearance is a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks. VoidB6: Your clothes and hair seem to float about you, as if you were adrift in a weightless environment. You are immune to cold damage and no longer need to breathe. You can exist comfortably in the depths of outer space. War: You are surrounded by the sounds of battle. You gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls with your deity's favored weapon and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with your deity's favored weapon each time you hit a foe. You can use your deity's favored weapon as a divine focus or holy symbol. Water: You gain gills, webbed fingers, and other ichthyic features. You gain a swim speed of 40 feet, can breathe water, and ignore the usual penalties on weapon attack and damage rolls from fighting underwater. Weather: Your hair and clothing are constantly wind-tossed, and you crackle with electricity. You do not take penalties or damage or suffer from reduced visibility or other effects due to natural weather. You are immune to electricity damage, and your call lightning and call lightning storm spells and effects always function as though called outdoors in stormy weather.",Planar Adventures,1,1,1,0,0,,,6,,4,,4,,,6,6,6,4,,,,6,,Infuse yourself with the powers of your deity’s planar realm.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,5003,1000,,,,,0,,,,4,,6,,,,4,,0,0,0,
