A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.",PFRPG Core,1,1,0,0,0,3,3,3,4,,3,3,,3,3,3,3,3,3,,,3,"Magic (3), Entropy (3)",Cancels one magical spell or effect.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Dispel Magic,159,,Arcane (7),,"When used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance. This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.

Third, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target. This powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges. This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down. This mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use atonement to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; remove curse also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the reprobation.",Ultimate Magic,1,1,0,0,1,,,5,5,,,4,,,,4,5,,,,,5,,Marked target is shunned by your religion.,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Reprobation,1129,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,5,,0,0,0,

Legends say that the first eaglesoul spell was created when an agathion avoral joined his own spirit with that of a courageous paladin who was about to be overwhelmed on the field of battle. The holy knight used the combined might of the agathion's great strength and his own to win the day for the crusaders. Now, although the spell is still in use chiefly among those that patrol the borders of the Worldwound, other champions of good have carried it with them to all corners of the Inner Sea region. When you cast this spell, you reach into the great beyond and beseech a good-aligned outsider for their aid against evil. The outsider infuses a small portion of its own power into you, making you a powerful force for good. You gain a +2 morale bonus on all Perception checks made against evil creatures, a +2 bonus on Initiative checks, and detect evil as a constant spell-like ability. In addition, once during the spell's duration you can call forth a surge of holy power when fighting an evil creature. Doing so is a swift action that shortens the spell's remaining duration so that its remaining hours of duration become rounds of duration. For the rest of this duration, the surge of power grants you the following benefits: • A +2 sacred bonus to AC • A +4 sacred bonus to Strength • Resistance 5 to acid and fire • A +5 sacred bonus on all Intimidate checks made against evil creatures • Fast healing 2 • Any critical threat roll made against an evil creature with a weapon you wield is automatically confirmed. Although this surge of power can be activated against any evil opponent, this ability activates automatically as soon as you attack any evil outsider, regardless of whether you hit or not, and regardless of whether you actually recognize that the target is in fact an evil outsider. In such cases the activation is a free action.

Creatures tainted by demons include tieflings with demonic heritages, sorcerers with abyssal bloodlines, creatures affected by a succubus's profane gift, creatures with demonic implants (see page 44 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lords of Chaos, Book of the Damned, Vol. 2), or creatures who have the Demonic Obedience feat (Lords of Chaos 8), and those under significant demonic influence as determined by the GM.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures of the chosen subtype in the same manner as detailed in protection from evil.

When you cast this spell, choose a domain offered by your deity. You gain that domain's benefits from the list below, along with the listed physical changes; abilities that allow a saving throw use this spell's DC. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round-this provokes attacks of opportunity and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less than 10 minutes of the spell's duration remaining, you cannot change the selected domain in this way. If you change your domain, all ongoing effects from your previously chosen domain end. You must worship a single divinity in order to cast this spell, even if you do not normally cast divine spells. If you perform an action that blatantly violates your deity's precepts while under this spell's effects, invoke deity immediately ends and you are stunned for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. Invoke deity has the same alignment descriptors ([chaotic], [evil], [good], or [lawful]) as your deity's alignment. If an ability duplicates a spell, it functions as that spell heightened to a level equal to your invoke deity spell. Air: You become wispy and translucent. You gain a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability, or you increase your current fly speed by 30 feet-whichever results in a faster speed. While flying, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC. Animal: Your form becomes bestial with animalistic features. You gain low-light vision, scent, a +6 natural armor bonus, and a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size. If you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you increased one size category. You can use speak with animals at will. Artifice: Parts of your body are replaced by pistons and gears. You can be affected by spells that specifically affect constructs (such as make whole). You are immune to bleed, disease, and poison effects, and you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, mind-affecting effects, and necromancy effects. Chaos: Your flesh churns and swirls chaotically. You are immune to additional damage from critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attack damage), and weapons you wield count as chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Charm: You become overwhelmingly attractive and persuasive. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma. Community: Your voice echoes with the sound of multitudes. Select a number of creatures within 30 feet equal to your level divided by three-you gain the effects of status and telepathic bond with those creatures. Darkness: Your eyes become solid black orbs. You become immune to blindness and can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell. Death: Your flesh becomes pallid. You are healed by both positive and negative energy, are immune to energy drain and death effects, and automatically stabilize when reduced below 0 hit points. Destruction: The air around you crackles. You gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with two-handed melee weapons. Spells you cast that cause hit point damage have their save DCs (if any) increased by 1. You gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks to break objects, and you ignore the first 5 points of hardness any object has when you attack it with a melee weapon. Earth: Your flesh becomes stony. You gain DR 10/bludgeoning and are immune to petrification effects. Evil: Your appearance becomes corrupted and fiendish. You automatically confirm critical hits, and weapons you wield count as evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Fire: Your hair ignites into flames. You are immune to fire. As a standard action once per minute, you can fire a ray of flame, as per scorching ray (limit one ray). Glory: Your countenance becomes stern and implacable, and your wrath devastates the undead. You gain the benefits of heroism and protection from evil, and your first successful attack each round against an undead target deals an additional 1d6 points of positive energy damage. Good: Your appearance becomes pristine and angelic. You are immune to fear and compulsion effects, and weapons you wield count as good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Healing: Your appearance becomes hale and hearty. You gain fast healing 3, and your spells and class features that restore hit points each restore an additional 1d8 hit points. Knowledge: You are surrounded by the sound of numerous turning pages. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. Law: A haze of mathematical symbols hovers around you. You are immune to hostile transmutation effects and all confusion effects, and weapons you wield count as lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Liberation: Your form becomes lithe and flexible. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. Luck: The faint sound of tinkling bells plays around you. You gain a +1 luck bonus to your Armor Class and on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks. As an immediate action, you can force a single creature within 10 feet to reroll a single d20 it just rolled-you must use this ability before the results of the d20 roll are known. Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of invoke deity decreases by 10 minutes, and you can't use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell's duration. Madness: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality. As a standard action, you can inflict madness on a creature within 30 feet; that creature must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. You cannot target a creature more than once a minute with this effect. Magic: You shimmer with magical power. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your caster level against hostile spells. Nobility: Your voice becomes resonant and imperious. As a move action, you can issue one order to a single creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as if you had cast the spell command. Plant: Your appearance becomes plantlike, with leafy hair and green skin. You become immune to paralysis, poison, polymorph effects, sleep effects, and stunning. Protection: An aura of protective energy surrounds you. Select three of the following spells: delay poison, false life, mage armor, protection from chaos, protection from evil, protection from good, protection from law, resist energy, shield, or shield of faith; you gain the protective benefits of those spells. Repose: Your eyes become pure, bleak white. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom. Rune: Your skin is marked with runic tattoos. Your presence does not trigger the effects of glyphs of warding, symbol spells, and similar effects unless you choose to, and you are immune to their harmful effects. You can use read magic at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll's caster level. ScalykindB6: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect. Strength: Your body visibly ripples with muscle. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength. Sun: Your form blazes with solar light. You are immune to blindness, the dazzled condition, and all effects generated by powerful light (such as searing light, sunray, or the blinding light of a shining childB2), and you radiate light as the daylight spell. Creatures that are harmed or hindered by sunlight take a -2 penalty on attack rolls against you, and you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects originating from such creatures. Travel: Faint afterimages trail behind you when you move. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Trickery: Your appearance changes as you desire (as veil, except affecting only yourself). Changing your appearance is a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks. VoidB6: Your clothes and hair seem to float about you, as if you were adrift in a weightless environment. You are immune to cold damage and no longer need to breathe. You can exist comfortably in the depths of outer space. War: You are surrounded by the sounds of battle. You gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls with your deity's favored weapon and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with your deity's favored weapon each time you hit a foe. You can use your deity's favored weapon as a divine focus or holy symbol. Water: You gain gills, webbed fingers, and other ichthyic features. You gain a swim speed of 40 feet, can breathe water, and ignore the usual penalties on weapon attack and damage rolls from fighting underwater. Weather: Your hair and clothing are constantly wind-tossed, and you crackle with electricity. You do not take penalties or damage or suffer from reduced visibility or other effects due to natural weather. You are immune to electricity damage, and your call lightning and call lightning storm spells and effects always function as though called outdoors in stormy weather.",Planar Adventures,1,1,1,0,0,,,6,,4,,4,,,6,6,6,4,,,,6,,Infuse yourself with the powers of your deity’s planar realm.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,5003,1000,,,,,0,,,,4,,6,,,,4,,0,0,0,
