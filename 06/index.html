    <h2>Basic Recording</h2>

    <h3>Steps required</h3>
    <p>
        I made this video with the following steps. Use these steps to record and publish a simple YouTube video from your phone.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Step 1 - Research and Create Presentation.</b>
            As this is a complex subject requiring nuanced discussion of human behavior, an evidence based crisis prevention system was researched
            from the Crisis Prevention Institute was researched. Following this, the information on de-escilation  and crisis prevention was
            added to a power point. It is impotant to note that the adoption of CPI in any institution requires contracting with the Crisis Prevention
             Institute. This video explains basic strategies to de-escilate a anxious client but does not provide appropriate training for a health care setting.
              I do not own, and am not affiliated with the Crisis Prevention Institute. <br>

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Step 2 - Record.</b>
            I used a Logitech C270 web camera and a Blue Yeti Microphone in order to record the video.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Step 3 - Edit.</b>
            I used the Gallery to view all my videos and replay then for review.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Step 4 - Upload.</b>
            I used the share to YouTube option to upload the video.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Step 5 - Publish.</b>
            Let everything default in YouTube.
