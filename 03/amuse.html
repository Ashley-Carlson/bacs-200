        <h1>Top 3 Places to find stupid people on the internet</h1>
        <img src="top.jpeg" alt="Logo">
        <p>Ah, the internet, a wealth and collection of human information and achivements... and well,
        this. The internet is filled with stupid people doing stupid things in the name of online entertainement
        and this brief guide will show you were to find the dumbest people, and things, on the world wide web.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <h2><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holdmybeer/">r/HoldMyBeer</a></li></h2>
        <img src="hold_me_beer.jpeg"  width="500" height="350" alt="Logo">
        <p> We begin this list with a non to the great reddit. This site relies on user generated content
        to build endless content. On reddit everyone is trying to show their skills, and here we get to
       see them fail. r/HoldMyBeer is a collection of things done after, as you may have guessed, much drinking
      has occured. The people in these videos and images may not be dumb, but they certainly are drunk. </p>
      <br>
      <h2><li><a href="https://www.mostexclusivewebsite.com/#/">The Most Exclusive Website</a></li></h2>
      <img src="exclusive.jpeg.png"  width="500" height="350" alt="Logo">
      <p> Now not only is the internet filled with stupid people, but also sites. This site is one with
        not only no point for existance, it plays on our own stupidity by claiming to be exclusive. With only
        16 presses you can listen to a poorly mixed techno song and stare at your computer wondering how you got this
        far in life</p>
        <br>
        <h2><li><a href="http://papertoilet.com/">Toilet Paper</a></li></h2>
        <img src="tp.jpeg"  width="500" height="350" alt="Logo">
        <p> If you, like me, fall into the category of stupid then you will find
          endless hours proctrastinating on this site. Much like a cat, your only goal is to
          unravel the toilet paper on this site. However, the site is dumb, as if you finish,
        you have to clear the cache before begining again</p>
