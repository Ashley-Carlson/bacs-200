            When given the prompt, ‘who inspires me’, I thought long and hard about who I have looked up to my whole life, who I have sought to be like.
            While many would choose brilliant writers and activists such as Maya Angelou, or brilliant mathematicians such as Carl Gauss, I found these answers to be insincere.
            Like most 21st century children I looked up to characters from books and TV, not people. Growing up in the ghetto I saw both the good and the bad in the adults around me,
             and for this reason I chose not to idolize anyone. I claimed for many years that I had no idols, and I never would. As the years have rolled on however, I have found a new inspiration,
             one that I hope others may adopt.  See, as we grow we strive to become the individuals want to be. We find ourselves through the pain and suffering each day and grow into the adults we
             always wanted to know as children. We grow into the adults that we <b> want </b> to be. As I have grown from life’s trials I have turned into the adult that as a child I could have idolized.
             In fact, we all become what we idolize, so why not idolize ourselves and become authentic individuals. So, for this reason I will respond to the prompt, 'who inspires me', with a resounding 'I do! I inspire myself' and I encourage everyone else to do so. In
             choosing to be our own idol, we shift the power back into our hands, and hold ourselves acountable for our own mistakes. In idolizing ourselves, we can grow beyond the limitations
             that someone else has set and decide right and wrong from our own moral standards. Most importantly, in choosing to be our own idols, we can become truely, and authentically us.
